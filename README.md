## Description

Auction House is a web application developed as my semester project at Noroff School of Technology and Media. It allows users to participate in online auctions, featuring functionalities such as user registration, login, bidding on items, and listing items for others to bid on. Notably, this project is crafted with a focus on vanilla JavaScript, HTML, SCSS, and Bootstrap, showcasing the potential of these technologies in building a robust application.

**Key Features:**
- User registration
- User login
- Bidding on items
- Listing items for auction
